**<h1>Bank Customer Churn Analysis by using Power BI</h1>**

**This project aims to analyze bank customer churn data and identify factors that contribute to customer churn using Power BI.**  

**Data Source**  

**Dataset:** "Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv"  
This dataset includes information about customers such as credit_score, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, products_number, credit_card, active_member, churn, and more.  

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  

The following are some of the key performance indicators (KPIs) used to measure bank customer churn in this Power BI project:  

**Total Customers:** The total number of customers in the bank.  
Active Customers:** The number of customers who have used their accounts or made transactions within a specific time period (e.g., past month, past quarter).  
**Inactive Customers:** The number of customers who have not used their accounts or made transactions within a specific time period and also churned customers.  
**Credit Card Holders:** The number of customers who have at least one credit card with the bank.  
**Non-Credit Card Holders:** The number of customers who do not have any credit cards with the bank.  
**Exit Customers:** The number of customers who have closed their accounts or stopped using the bank's services within a specific time period.  
**Retain Customers:** The number of customers who continue to use the bank's services over a specified time period.  

**Analysis and Visualizations**  

The project analyzes bank customer churn data and identifies patterns and trends in the data that can help banks better understand the reasons behind customer churn. The following are some of the key analyses performed in this project:  

**Customers and Churn Status by Age Group:** Use Power BI to analyze the churn rate and status of customers by age group. Visualize the churn rate and status of customers by age group in bar charts or line charts to identify which age groups have a higher churn rate.  
**Customers and Churn Status by Credit Scores:** Use Power BI to analyze the churn rate and status of customers by their credit scores. Visualize the churn rate and status of customers by credit score range in bar charts or heat maps to identify which credit score ranges have a higher churn rate.  
**Customers and Churn Status by Account Balance:** Use Power BI to analyze the churn rate and status of customers by their account balance. Visualize the churn rate and status of customers by account balance in scatter plots or heat maps to identify which account balance ranges have a higher churn rate.  
**Credit Card Holders and Non-Holders:** Use Power BI to analyze the churn rate and status of credit card holders and non-holders. Visualize the churn rate and status of customers by credit card holder status in bar charts or pie charts to identify the churn rate of credit card holders compared to non-holders.  
**Exit Customers by Gender:** Use Power BI to analyze the churn rate and status of customers by gender. Visualize the churn rate and status of customers by gender in bar charts or heat maps to identify which gender has a higher churn rate.  
**Active Customers by Products:** Use Power BI to analyze the products that active customers are using. Visualize the number of active customers by product in bar charts or pie charts to identify which products are most popular with active customers.  
**Customers by Products:** Use Power BI to analyze the products that all customers are using. Visualize the number of customers by product in bar charts or pie charts to identify which products are most popular with all customers.  
**Customers by Country:** Use Power BI to analyze the churn rate and status of customers by country. Visualize the churn rate and status of customers by country in heat maps or maps to identify which countries have a higher churn rate.  

**Conclusion**  

Based on the analysis performed in this project, we can conclude that customers age from 25-45 are leaving the banks more, employees who's credit score range from 601-700 are having more churn rate. Customers having account balance ZERO(0) and range from 100k-200k are leaving the bank more. Females having high churn rate, and France country having the more number of customers. The insights gained from this analysis can help Banks to make informed decisions about customer retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction and retention rates.  

**How to Use this Power BI project:**  

Step1 : Consider data from mentioned .csv file
"Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv"  
Step2: Download "Bank Customer Churn Analysis.pbix" file from the repository  
Step3: Import .csv file in Power BI Desktop  
Step4: Use Power Query to clean and transform the data as needed.  
Step5: Create a reference copy of the data and create Age group copy of data. 
Step5: Similarly create reference copy for Account Balance Groups and Credit Score Groups.  
Step6: Use the Cards to create KPI's the data.  
Step7: Use the Line and Clustered column cahart, Stacked Bar charts and Donut charts to create visuals.
